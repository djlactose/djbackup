# djbackup
This utility was designed to create a very simple backup application for linux machines which could be run as a scheduled task.  This utility allows you to backup to multiple locations and will offsite the backups to the Cloud if the run would like.  Djbackup will also clean up it's own backup directories if the runner would like.
